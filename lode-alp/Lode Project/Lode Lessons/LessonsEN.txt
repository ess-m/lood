Vivid memories of transistors and warm plastic from a faraway place were distilled into a single voice of what we loved most. Lode is a monophonic bass synthesizer inspired by some of our most beloved vintage piecesâ€“ instruments that were much greater than the sum of their parts and full of character. In simplicity, there is a great reward in exploring inherent boundaries and making the most out of them; something that may seem uncomplicated at first often reveals a greater depth in its subtleties.
